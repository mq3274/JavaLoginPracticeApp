- **Maven**: Apache Maven is used for building the project. Download and install Maven from [Maven's official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). 📦
- **Apache Tomcat**: A web server and servlet container for deploying the WAR file. Download it from [Apache Tomcat's website](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi). 🖥️
- **Git**: Required for cloning the repository. Install Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 🧩

   ```

## Deployment Instructions:
1. **Build the Project**:
   - Use Maven to clean and package the application into a WAR file:
     ```bash
     mvn clean package

   - This command will generate a WAR file in the `target` directory (e.g., `target/JavaLoginShowcase.war`). 📦

2. **Deploy to Tomcat**:
   - Copy the WAR file to the Tomcat `webapps` directory:
     ```bash
     cp target/JavaLoginShowcase.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/
     ```
   - Restart the Tomcat server to deploy the WAR file:
     ```bash
     $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
     $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Once deployed, access the application through your web browser at:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/JavaLoginShowcase
     ```
